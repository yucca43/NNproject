DATA:
1. Sentiment 140 Data
	only has sentence level sentiment label
2. SemEval 2013 from york.ac.uk
	combine task a and task b to provide some phrasal sentiment to use RecursiveNN

Possible RNN models:

RNN 1 baseline
RNN 2
RNN 2 with dropout
RNTN 
think about what improvement you can bring to the RNN2 model

Use:
Preprocess Twitter data
Glove pretrained word vectors?


TODO:
